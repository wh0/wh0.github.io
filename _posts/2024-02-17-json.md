Let's actually write down the rule for what values inside a program we call JSON and what values we don't call JSON.
I don't know if there are any other guidelines out there, but I've decided for myself at least.
This is matter of taste in metonymy.

## The rule

| Value                                 | What to call it        |
|:--------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| Data encoded in JSON                  | **Call it JSON**       |
| The kind of data that JSON can encode | **Don't call it JSON** |

## Examples

```js
const a = '{"port": 3000}';
const b = JSON.parse(a);
const c = {port: 3000};
const d = {"port": 3000};
const e = JSON.stringify(c);
const f = require('./config.json');
const g = await (await fetch('http://localhost:3000/config')).json();
const h = /\s+/g;
const i = {source: h.source, flags: h.flags};
const j = JSON.stringify(i);
const k = JSON.parse(j);
const l = new RegExp(k.source, k.flags);
```

**a** is a string of JSON-encoded data.
**It's JSON.**

**b** is a value decoded from JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**c** is a value that can be expressed in JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**d** is a value created from a literal, where the literal is valid JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**e** is the result of encoding something in JSON.
**It's JSON.**

**f** is a value loaded from a JSON file, which is already decoded.
**It's not JSON.**

**g** is a value received from a server that is sent encoded in JSON and then decoded, and it's additionally the result of a method named `json`.
**It's not JSON.**

**h** is a value that can't be expressed in JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**i** is a value specially created for the purpose of serializing something in JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**j** is result of encoding that special value in JSON.
**It's JSON.**

**k** is a value specially created for the purpose of deserializing something from JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

**l** is a value that can't be expressed in JSON.
**It's not JSON.**

## What to call values that aren't JSON

- config
- user info
- API response
- payload
- the message object
- record
- products by ID
- object ðŸ˜†
- plain old

## Say more when it is JSON

Extra note, when you say "You get the info in JSON,"
you really should be saying "You get a User object in JSON.
What?
No I don't have documentation for it.
You'll have to get one and figure it out.
Oh and some of the numerical fields are strings, so watch out for that."
