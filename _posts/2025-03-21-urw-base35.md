In `~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/70-no-urw-base35.conf`:

```xml
<fontconfig>
  <selectfont>
    <rejectfont>
      <glob>/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1/*</glob>
      <glob>/usr/share/fonts/opentype/urw-base35/*</glob>
      <glob>/usr/share/fonts/type1/urw-base35/*</glob>
    </rejectfont>
  </selectfont>
</fontconfig>
```

Because.
They ... I don't know.
They look like this.

![](/assets/2025/urw-base35-nimbus-mono.png)

_This is a screenshot of example.com with the font changed.
Which might not be the most proper way to render a type specimen, but at least it was easy.
This is Nimbus Mono PS with the body text at 12px._

![](/assets/2025/urw-base35-nimbus-roman.png)

_This is Nimbus Roman._

![](/assets/2025/urw-base35-nimbus-sans.png)

_This is Nimbus Sans._

Do they have too much uh...
Anyway, it's a personal preference.

## Why are they even installed

I have Ghostscript installed, which [a survey reports is normal](https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=ghostscript).
As a consequence, I have its free fonts installed too.
That, too, [seems to be normal](https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=fonts-urw-base35)---by a hair.

Asking Debian's APT to remove the package, `fonts-urw-base35` causes `ghostscript` to be removed too.
Which why do I have Ghostscript in the first place?
Apparently it's recommended by ImageMagick, which is recommended by... a barcode scanner, and that's a dependency of `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`.
And I want to be able to [change my desktop wallpaper](https://wh0.github.io/2020/02/18/libkate.html), so yeah.

## Who even asks for these fonts

Some of these fonts, such as Nimbus Mono PS, Nimbus Roman, and Nimbus Sans, show up pretty often.
If a website uses CSS such as this:

```css
code {
  font-family: Courier, monospace;
}
```

Nimbus Mono PS gets matched for being metric compatible with Courier, even though the site might not particularly desire metric compatibility.
Similarly, Nimbus Roman shows up when Times is specified; Nimbus Sans for Helvetica.

## Having them installed but ignoring them

Anyway, most of my stuff uses fontconfig to determine that e.g. Nimbus Mono PS is a good substitute for Courier, and there's a way to tell fontconfig to ignore these fonts.
With no thanks to the [documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html) which is very unspecific about how to use `<rejectfont>`.
