Check out this ad, it's one of those interactive ones that lets you try out a small part of the game. This is the mythical "level 2" of that ad.

Aside for people who haven't seen the ad: you tap to unscrew one screw at a time, and then you tap again to screw it into an unoccupied hole. That causes pieces to fall, and you eventually get all the pieces off the board. End aside for people who haven't seen the ad.

You get here by working through the first level, which is simpler, but still takes about 20ish taps of moving screws around. Look for a screw and an empty hole, tap-tap. Have you chosen which screw to move where? Okay. Ready, aim, tap---

Level 2 isn't playable. It's just a normal ad now, so tapping anywhere on it takes you to the store page.

Any interactions after clicking the ad are purely between you and the store. Thanks for trying the game, bye!

Here's a composite showing how certain elements are positioned on the two screens.
