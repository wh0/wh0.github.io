The game has its own intro paragraph, so I'll just start talking.

You ever see those game ads where you fight enemies based on simple number comparisons, and there's also powerups that e.g. double your power etc.?
I wondered, can a game in that format actually be hard?

Kind of, I think.
At least without using a calculator.
